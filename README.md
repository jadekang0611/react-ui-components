## Purpose

I built this repository not only to gain a deep understanding of the ins and outs of each UI component but also to provide a valuable resource for other developers. By creating these components from scratch without relying on UI libraries, I have honed my skills and knowledge in TypeScript, styled-components, and React. This project serves as a learning opportunity for others who want to understand the inner workings of these UI elements and develop a strong foundation in building custom UI components.
