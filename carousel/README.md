## What is Carousel UI?

Carousel refers to a rotating merry-go-round in its literal sense. On the web, it means a UI that cycles through content such as images, videos, and more in a slide format.

## What's Important in Building Carousel UI?

- Do not use autoplay.
- Allow users to directly control the carousel.
- For most users, the carousel is a common UI element, and they are already familiar with interacting with it.
- Write concise and clear copy.
- <strong>Do not use an h1 tag inside the slider.</strong>
  - Search engines treat h1 tags as headings, so having multiple titles on one page, as in the case of multiple slides, can cause issues.
- <strong>Verify if the carousel is touch-friendly.</strong>
  - On mobile devices, swiping to navigate through content instead of using left and right arrows is a familiar user experience.
