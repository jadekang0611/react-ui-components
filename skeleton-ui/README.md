## Skeleton Rules for a Better UX

- Skeleton should not impede the loading of content.
- <strong>When designing a skeleton, it is good to use animation.</strong> Animation, such as wave, pulse, or fading wave, can create a perception of shorter loading time.
- Using slow and steady animations can create a perception of shorter loading time.
