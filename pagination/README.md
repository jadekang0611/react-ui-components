## What is Pagination?

Pagination is a technique used in web development to <strong>divide large sets of data into smaller, more manageable chunks called pages</strong>. It is commonly employed in scenarios where displaying all data at once would be impractical or overwhelming for users.

## Benefits of Pagination

&#9632; Improved performance

<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">By loading and displaying a limited number of items at a time, <i>pagination reduces the initial load time and improves the overall performance</i> of the application. This is particularly important when dealing with extensive collections of data.</blockquote>

&#9632; Enhanced readability and usability

<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">Breaking down data into pages makes it easier for users to digest information. Users can focus on one page of data at a time, preventing overwhelming displays and enhancing readability.</blockquote>

&#9632; Efficient navigation

<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">Pagination allows users to navigate through data using intuitive controls. They can easily move between pages to find specific information or browse through the dataset in a structured manner.</blockquote>

&#9632; Optimized resource usage

<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">With pagination, server resources and network bandwidth are utilized more efficiently. Only the required data for the current page is retrieved and displayed, reducing unnecessary data transfer and improving scalability.</blockquote>

&#9632; Search engine optimization (SEO)

<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">Pagination can be beneficial for search engine optimization by providing distinct URLs for each page, making it easier for search engines to crawl and index the content.</blockquote>

## Pagination for a better user experience

- Provide larger sizes for clickable elements.
- Display the current page.
- Provide previous and next page links.
- Increase the spacing between page links.
